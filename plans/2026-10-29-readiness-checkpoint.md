# IRMS autonomous continuation checkpoint

Updated: 2026-10-29, Asia/Taipei. State: readiness, R01 (`df2c5bd`) and R02 (`10b2fd0`) pushed as draft [PR #5](https://github.com/yuhina0515/IRMS/pull/5); R03 confirmation accessibility validated for delivery to the same PR. Automation `irms-squad` is ACTIVE, hourly, in this chat. Next task R04 follows PR/CI and quota inspection. Overall objective remains active.

- Base branch: codex/irms-progress-20261020, commit 6c6241765f6ba33a46ff0018143616bffa675875 (draft PR #4; depends on draft #3).
- Plan: 2026-10-29-readiness-plan.md; backlog/evidence: ../doc/RESEARCH_READINESS.md; handoff: ../doc/coding log/log_20261029_squad_readiness.md.

- Before work: inspect `git status`, PR status and fresh limits. Do not redo the completed audit. Never mix unrelated modifications into a commit.

## Completed batch
Telemetry now has serialized byte/count limits, shared native/frontend payload checks, collector-switch purge and stale-result isolation. Settings number fields have associated labels; toast speech uses persistent polite/error regions. Independent security follow-up found no new regression. Primary-source examples map UW CSE 481S and Edinburgh DISS requirements without claiming general university approval.

Validation: 56 frontend files / 533 tests; TypeScript and Vite build passed. Cargo fmt, 104 Rust tests (3 live tests ignored) and Clippy all-targets/all-features with warnings denied passed. Native screen-reader, BLE/OTA and participant testing were not run. hina-tw.ddns.net collector health returned HTTP 200 / ok; no service changes. Antigravity command absent on PATH.

## Next concrete task
R01 completed locally: original failure reproduced, monotonic receiver clock and >250ms gap/clock-anomaly restart implemented, rest gating preserved, sparse success fixtures explicitly streamed, SessionController zero progress/no GOAL regression added. Latest frontend validation: 56 files / 542 tests, typecheck and production build passed. Prior CI run 40808318776 confirmed SUCCESS before R01 push; check new head independently. Rust unchanged this batch.

R02 completed locally: shared downloader now bounds each accumulated response, with fixed metadata/signature caps and exact verified payload sizes. All call sites migrated; signatures/hashes/cache fallback unchanged. 14 focused firmware tests passed; full Rust 110 passed / 3 live ignored, fmt/Clippy passed. Frontend remains R01's verified 542 tests/typecheck/build. No live release or native OTA acceptance.

R03 completed locally: body portal, original inert-state restoration/observer, keyboard/focus/click containment, 150ms close/replace semantics, message description and immediate hardware emergency takeover. Baseline Tab-wrap regression failed then passed. New tests include emergency focus race and StrictMode replay. Typecheck, 57 frontend files / 553 tests, Vite build passed. Rust unchanged; last R02 result remains 110 passed / 3 live ignored. Native WebView/screen-reader acceptance and other overlays remain open.

R04 active plan: 2026-10-29-ble-notification-plan.md. Missing generation gating exists inside the notification loop; stale acquisition errors and stream-end clearing also need correct isolation. A simple atomic check followed by emit has a race with invalidation. Engineering reviewer recommends a short synchronous epoch gate around actual dispatch, shared by begin/invalidate, with no await or recursive epoch/peripheral lock in callback. Lock ordering: peripheral -> epoch; stream-end acquires peripheral before rechecking epoch and clearing/emitting. Exercise current/stale normal/raw/OTA callbacks through the production routing helper and deterministic barrier-based invalidation ordering. Native concurrent connect/scan/setup cancellation remains a separate open lifecycle risk; do not claim solved by this guard.

## Quota / environment
Latest observed remaining quota (R03 start): five-hour 66%, weekly 91%; initial 95%/95%. These are shared account percentages, not task token counts. Re-check on every run. Do not start expensive work if any known window <=20%; resume only when all known windows >=30%. Unknown quota: short inspection only. No credits, resets or credential switching. Do not leave workers active at a checkpoint.

Dependencies installed with `npm.cmd ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`. npm package-script Windows shims failed with `"node" is not recognized` even though direct Node works; changing PATHEXT did not fix it. Verified direct equivalents:

```powershell
node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit
node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run --maxWorkers=1 --no-file-parallelism
node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build
$env:CARGO_BUILD_JOBS='1'
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR='E:\Monitoring-and-IoT\IRMS-wt\squad-20261020\IRMS_App_Tauri\src-tauri\target'
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Run from IRMS_App_Tauri. The target cache is generated output only; no edits were made to the older worktree's tracked files. Avoid simultaneous Cargo runs on that cache. Vite reports existing large Leg3D chunk / ineffective ToolsView dynamic import warnings; not failures and not fixed in this batch. Crash-recovery test intentionally emits `view crashed` while passing.

## Boundaries
Preserve original archive Cargo.toml/.claude logs and older squad worktree's HOME/architecture notes. No automatic PR merges, production restart/deployment, firmware upload, participant recruitment or private-data publication. Already-issued telemetry requests cannot be recalled. No universal country, university or demographic suitability claims. Use existing scoped authorization; do not repeatedly ask for implementation permission.
